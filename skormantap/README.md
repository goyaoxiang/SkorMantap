Introducing **SkorMantap**, a centralised digital local learning platform, which aligns with SDG 4: Quality Education. 

*Proudly developed by team daheckkkk - Ting Juin, Chea Hao, Yao Xiang and Leon.* 
___

It aims to address the following issues: 
- **Limited transparency and engagement**: Students are unable to determine if a tutor is reliable or not, leading to high costs of trial and error. Additionally, the *unorganised and excessive information* makes it difficult for students to find the right tutor.

- **Low visibility and exposure**: Tutors struggle to reach out to eager learners, which affects their income and passion.

- **Reliability anxiety**: Parents have doubts about the reliability of tutors and worry about their childâ€™s academic performance.

We provide this **SkorMantap** platform that offers transparency, engagement and reliability. This platform can help students find the right tutor, while tutors can reach out to more students and build their reputation. Parents can rest assured that their child is receiving quality education and is keeping up with their academic performance.
